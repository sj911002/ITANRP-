# ITANRP-Algorithm

Image texture adaptive non-uniformrectangular partition (ITANRP). 

In this project I have implemented the ITANRP algorithm proposed in the paper. The ITANRP is used as a method of image preprocessing, which divides the original image I into image blocks with different sizes according to the error control value Îµ. Unlike the usual block-based JPEG compression algorithm which uses uniform partition as an image preprocessing method, it extracts the distribution information of image texture complexity in the form of different size image blocks. The goal of ITANRP is to generate a non-uniform rectangular partition mesh to represent the distribution of image texture complexity and obtain the block classification information based on the distribution of texture complexity.
